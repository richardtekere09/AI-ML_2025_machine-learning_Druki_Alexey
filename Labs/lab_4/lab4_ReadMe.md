# ðŸ“š Laboratory Work â„–4: Image Recognition Using ResNet (CIFAR-10 Dataset)

## Introduction
This laboratory work is devoted to gaining practical skills in image recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with a particular focus on the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture implemented in the Keras library.

The work involves using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images of 10 different classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
