**Working with Tabular Data Using the Keras Library**

---

## 📚 Description

This laboratory work focuses on:
- Acquiring experience in working with tabular datasets,
- Preprocessing and preparing data for machine learning,
- Solving multiclass and binary classification problems using fully connected neural networks,
- Studying and applying the functionality of the **Keras** machine learning library.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop skills in loading, preprocessing, and analyzing tabular data using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**.
- Learn how to build, train, and evaluate artificial neural networks using **Keras**.
- Solve both multiclass and binary classification problems on real-world datasets.

## 🛠 Tasks

1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
2. Encode categorical features and labels.
3. Normalize numerical features.
4. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
5. Design and build deep learning models using **Keras Sequential API**.
6. Compile models with appropriate optimizers, loss functions, and metrics.
7. Train models and monitor the learning process (accuracy and loss curves).
8. Evaluate models on the test data and analyze the results.
