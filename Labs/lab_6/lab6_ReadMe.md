# Image Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform semantic segmentation on grayscale medical images. The model is trained and evaluated using the Keras deep learning library in Google Colab.

## Objective

- Learn how to build and train convolutional neural networks for image segmentation tasks.
- Apply deep learning techniques to distinguish and segment structures in grayscale images.
- Visualize and evaluate the modelâ€™s segmentation performance.

## Dataset

- **Medical Membrane Images (ISBI 2012-like)**: Grayscale images of size 512x512 pixels.
- Dataset split:
  - **Training set**: 30 images and masks.
  - **Testing set**: 30 images and masks.
- Images represent cell membranes and require binary segmentation.

## Project Structure

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
    - Load images and masks from Google Drive.
    - Normalize pixel values to [0,1].
    - Reshape data to fit the model input requirements.
2. **Model Construction**
    - Build a simple sequential CNN model:
        - Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activations.
        - Final Conv2D layer with sigmoid activation for pixel-wise prediction.
3. **Model Training**
    - Compile the model with Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
    - Train the model using the training dataset.
4. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the model performance on the test dataset using MSE.
5. **Visualization**
    - Predict segmentation masks for test images.
    - Display the predicted masks to assess model quality visually.

      ```

3. Run the Python script or Colab notebook:
    ```bash
    python segmentation_lab6.py
    ```

4. Outputs:
    - Training history (loss reduction per epoch).
    - Model evaluation on the test set.
    - Visualization of segmented images.

## Results

- The CNN model successfully segmented cell membranes from grayscale images.
